Topic: Prime Numbers

Introduction:
In mathematics, prime numbers play a crucial role as they are the building blocks for all other numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. They are the fundamental components of the number system and have unique properties that distinguish them from other numbers.

Key Concepts:
1. Definition of Prime Numbers: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. Sieve of Eratosthenes: An ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a given limit.
3. Prime Factorization: Breaking down a number into its prime factors, which are prime numbers that multiply together to give the original number.
4. Distribution of Prime Numbers: Prime numbers are infinite and become less frequent as numbers get larger, following certain patterns like the Prime Number Theorem.

Applications:
1. Cryptography: Prime numbers are essential in modern encryption techniques to secure data and communications.
2. Number Theory: Prime numbers are at the heart of many mathematical proofs and conjectures.
3. Computer Science: Prime numbers are used in algorithms and data structures for efficient computations.

Activities:
1. Sieve of Eratosthenes Hands-On Activity: Students can physically sieve out prime numbers up to a certain range to understand the concept.
2. Prime Factorization Game: A game where students compete to factorize numbers into their prime components in a race against time.
3. Real-World Applications Research: Students can explore how prime numbers are used in cryptography, number theory, and computer science and present their findings.

Assessment:
1. Quiz on Prime Numbers: Assess students' understanding of prime number properties, factorization, and applications.
2. Problem-Solving Tasks: Present students with real-world problems that involve prime numbers and evaluate their problem-solving skills.
3. Project Presentation: Have students work on a
